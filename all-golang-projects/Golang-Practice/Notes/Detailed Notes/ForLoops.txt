Go does not have a while loop, it has only one looping construct, the `for` loop.
Here is an example:
--------------------------
for i := 0; i < 10; i++{
    sum += i
}
--------------------------

This outputs 45. 
Breaking it down, sum := 0 initializes a variable named sum and assigns it the value of 0. You cannot do `var sum int = 0` 
`for i := 0; i < 10; i++` is a loop that starts with i at 0 and increments i by 1 in each iteration until i is no longer less than 10.
Sum += i is shorthand for sum = sum + i. It adds the value of i to the sum variable in each iteration.
So, this code calculates the sum of integers from 0 to 9 (inclusive) and stores the result in the variable sum, basically 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9.

Honestly I have no idea what that means I just copied part of it from ChatGPT.
Honestly I'm trying to understand but I cannot ðŸ˜…
