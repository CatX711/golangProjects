You can create aliases for functions by setting a variable to a functions name
(not return value)

E.g

// pl() is now an alias for println
var pl = fmt.Println 

You can use pl() in your code as you  would with fmt.Println()
Aliases are possible with any function.

When importing you can also make an alias for the package inside it.
E.g

import blabla "go-myproject/mypackage"


Then to use something inside you would write 

blabla.FuncName()
